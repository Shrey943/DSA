Stack : Ab dekho yaar, basics toh tumko pata hi h ki LIFO aur FILO hota h.
        Stack ki ek limit hoti h(size) jisse jyada element insert krne ki koshis ko stack overflow kehte h

Ab Main, Stack ek bahut important DS hota h. Apna android mai activities bhi stack mai hi store hoti h.
         Stack memory toh yaad h na, vo bhi stack to implement kr ke hi bani h. saare functions stack mai arrange hote h.
         Aur bhi kai applications h, neech dekho

Operations : push(),pop(), peek(), isFull(), isEmpty(), stackTop(), stackBottom() 

### for stack using array, all the operations time complexity is constant i.e. O(1) ###

                                        STACK USING LINKED LIST

# In linked list since the time complexity to insert and delete at first position is O(1). Therefore, first node is 
  taken as TOP of stack.

### Since in Linked list, there is no size boundations therefore, isFull is determined by the limit of memory in heap
    as after one time, when we ask cpu for memory it returns null. That's the condition of stack full. ###

# Also you can set a size limit any time for your stack by keeping the record of size.
