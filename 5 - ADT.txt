ADT: Abstract Data Type 

Abstract means hidden(in adt all methods are hidden we can call any method and need not to worry about the code.)

ADT is something which have some minimal requirements and other additional methods or features.
ex: array, minimal requirements = get any element by index and set any element by index./
           additional           = insert,delete,resize,length, etc. 

Array : array is the sequence of data stored in continous address. It can store any data type(one at a time)
        like int, float, custom.

        We can get and set any element on array at O(1) time using address - Advantage
        for ex: address of first element is x then adress of nth element is : x + 4(n)
                asumming array of a integer with 4 bit each.

        But we can not change the size of array in C. So inserting or deleting  any element at any position 
        turns out to as costly as O(n) as if element at first position is removed then decrease the index of 
        all elements by 1.(need to go through n elements.) 

STATIC ARRAY : who's size cant be changed. ex: normal array in C.

DYNAMIC ARRAY : who's size can be changed. ex: array as an abstract data type.(using structure)
