Time complexity or complexity refers to : Big O
it is the time program takes
all the constants are always ignored and only the main n part is seen.
ex:
for(i,i<n,i++){}
for(j,j<n,j++){}

it takes 2n time.
So, its time complexity is O(n)

for (i,i*i<n,i++){}
its time complexity is O(root n).

for (i,i*i<10000,i++){}
its time complexity is O(1) : constant value kuch bhi ho, likhte O(1) hi h


#####Apan ko assume nai krna h kuch input try kr kr ke ki beech mai
     break ho jayegi, worst case ke hissab se bolo.######


for(i,i<n,i++){
   for(j,j<n,j++){}
}
iski complexity O(n^2) h.
