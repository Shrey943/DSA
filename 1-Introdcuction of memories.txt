ds deals with memory 
algo deals with time

legacy data -  data which is different from main data(stored differently) 
               and could be used in future for annalysis
DATABASE(stored in permanent storage for fast updation and deletion) , 

DATA WAREHOUSE(anagement of huge data of legacy data( the data we keep 
at a different place from our fresh data in the database to make the process of 
retrieval and updation fast) for better analysis.) , 

BIG DATA :- large amount of data that can not be processed by traditional data processing applications.

RAM ->  HEAP MEMORY    -  Dynamic Memory which could be allocated and deallocated(released) within a function.
            |             uses : malloc(), calloc(), free(), realloc()
            |             
        STACK MEMORY   -  memory is stacked according to function call, and remains till the function 
            |             returns any value, once retured it frees the memory.
            |
        Uninitialised  - All the variables are stored here, more the variable, more memory used.
           and

        Code Segment

# When ever a function is called, its all code (variables) are stacked in stack memory and as soon as return 
called, it frees all the memory. STATIC keyword can be used for both variable and function so its memory is 
not freed after return and can be used afterwards.

# Static keyword increses the scope of a variable or function to global.
