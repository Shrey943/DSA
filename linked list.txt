Linked list : linked list kuch nai bs ek naye type ka data stucture h jisme every element is known as node 
              and each node contain 2 memory blocks : data block and address block. data block store data and 
              address block store address of next node(thats why is of pointer type of node).
              (if its a last element than address block store NULL)

              Disadvantage : 2X memory leta h batao, ek data ki ek next pointer ki, transversing is difficult.
                             koi bhi element access krne mai zrada time le ga(time complexity to get element is O(n)
                             while of array is O(1))
              Advantage : Pehle se memory bhar ke nai rakhni padti, jaha chaahe waaha pe insert and delete kr
                          do, koi transversing ki zarurat nai.(kyoki khiskaane ki zarurat nai).
                          Free hoke jitna appennd krna h karo
